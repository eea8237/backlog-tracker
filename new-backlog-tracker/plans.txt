ok so i want something to replace my little watch / playlist thing

start simple - just keep track of a list that I can add / remove items from
    and i can mark the items as complete

what else?
    easy stuff
        add the ability to keep track of multiple lists
        separate a single list into sections
        group items into a category

    medium stuff
        add the ability to comment on items in the list
        add like a profile to this whole thing
        edit name of an item on the list

    hard stuff
        integrate csec into this somehow
            maybe add some password protection
            maybe add some encryption / decryption
        give this a GUI
        add an incentive for completing tasks
            like cookies or something

what do i need for this?
    an object representing a list
        Backlog
            items - list or set of items
            addItem() - Item
            removeItem() - Item
            save() - void [save list to a file]
            load() - void [create a list from a file (probably static)]
            contains() - boolean
            toString() - String
    an object for an item on the list
        Item
            name - String
            isComplete - boolean
            series - String
            medium - Category
            markComplete() - void
            markIncomplete() - void
            toString() - String
        should it be comparable?
    an enum to denote what medium each item in the list belongs to
    an enum to denote what section each item in the list belongs to
