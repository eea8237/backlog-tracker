ok so i want something to replace my little watch / playlist thing

start simple - just keep track of a list that I can add / remove items from
    and i can mark the items as complete

what else?
    easy stuff
        add the ability to keep track of multiple lists
        separate a single list into sections

    medium stuff
        add the ability to comment on items in the list
        add like a profile to this whole thing

    hard stuff
        integrate csec into this somehow
            maybe add some password protection
            maybe add some encryption / decryption
        give this a GUI

what do i need for this?
    an object representing a list
        Backlog
            items - list or set of items
            addItem() - Item
            removeItem() - Item
            save() - void [save list to a file]
            load() - void [create a list from a file (probably static)]
            toString() - String
    an object for an item on the list
        Item
            name - String
            isComplete - boolean
            markComplete() - void
            markIncomplete() - void
        should it be comparable?
